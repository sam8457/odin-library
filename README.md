# Odin Library

A project from Odin's course on fullstack Javascript development meant to practice
JS objects and how they can be implemented to make interactive cards on a webpage.

I also took it as an opportunity to learn a new framework, Bootstrap, which I used
instead of CSS. Everything outside the Bootstrap folder is my work.
